Subject: [Your Full Name] - Frontend Engineer Application

Hi Evil Martians Team,

Here is my submission for the Frontend Engineer position.

**Login Form SPA**
- **Live Demo:** [Deploy manually to GitHub Pages and insert link here]
- **Source Code:** [Insert GitHub Repo Link Here]

**Approach:**
I built this SPA from scratch using React and TypeScript, without any UI libraries. I focused on:
- **Accessibility:** Using semantic HTML, `aria-invalid` states, and keyboard navigation support.
- **UX:** Smooth animations, clear error feedback, and loading states.
- **Architecture:** Clean component separation (`LoginForm`, `Input`, `Button`) and a mock API layer (`mockFetch`) that simulates latency and network errors.
- **Design:** A custom "Martian" theme using CSS variables and glassmorphism.

**About Me**
I am a [Your Role, e.g., Senior Frontend Engineer] with a passion for building robust developer tools. At [Previous Company], I led the migration of our core dashboard to a micro-frontend architecture, reducing build times by 40% and improving team velocity.

**Consultancy Story**
In a previous role/freelance project for a fintech client, I was tasked with "revamping the user settings". The requirements were vague. Instead of coding immediately, I:
1.  Interviewed the stakeholders to understand the core pain points (compliance data was hard to find).
2.  Prosed a phased approach: first fixing the information architecture, then the visual refresh.
3.  Managed the scope by pushing back on "nice-to-have" animations that would delay the MVP.
Result: We shipped the compliance module 2 weeks early, directly impacting their ability to launch in a new market.

**Logistics**
- **Current Location:** [Your City, Country]
- **Relocation:** Open to relocating to Portugal (or Remote).

Best regards,
[Your Name]
