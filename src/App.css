  /* Actually, for Stripe Style, let's do a simple diagonal background on the container itself or a pseudo-element if needed.
     But keeping it simple and clean as per reference image which shows a white card on a very light grey background.
     The reference image 0 has a white card on white/light grey. 
     Reference image 1 has a gradient background (colorful).
     
     User provided TWO images. 
     Image 0: Register - Clean white card on white.
     Image 1: Login - Colorful gradient background. 
     
     "see how login and join routes are designed"
     Login -> Colorful Gradient (Image 1)
     Join -> Clean White (Image 0)
     
     This implies I might need different layouts? 
     But the user said "is every route using same features".
     
     I will stick to a clean, subtle background for now to be safe and consistent, 
     or maybe a subtle gradient. 
     Let's remove the "GLOW" (red) and replace with a subtle slanted strip or just clean.
     Given "Zero UI Libraries" and "Simple", I'll go with a subtle slanted background to be "Stripe-like" without over-engineering.

  /* This matches the colorful login image (Image 1) somewhat? */
  /* Wait, Image 1 has a purple/pink/blue gradient. */
  /* Let's try to match Image 1 for the "background" vibe if possible, or just clean. */
  /* Clean is safer for "professional". But Image 1 IS colorful. */
  /* I'll use a subtle rotated background element. */
